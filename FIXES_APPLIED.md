# Fixes Applied for Recording & AI Feedback Issues

## Date: October 26, 2025

## Problems Identified

### 1. ❌ Video Recording Not Saving Chunks
**Issue**: MediaRecorder was not consistently capturing video data because `start()` was called without a `timeslice` parameter.

**Root Cause**: Without a timeslice, the MediaRecorder only fires the `dataavailable` event when `stop()` is called, which could lead to data loss or timing issues.

### 2. ❌ AI Feedback Data Being Reset (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Visual sentiment data (ratings, scores) was being reset to default values BEFORE the FeedbackScreen could use it.

**Root Cause**: 
- In `useVisualSentiment.ts`, there was a `useEffect` that triggered when `isStarted` became `false`
- When the user clicked stop, `handleStop()` set `isStarted = false`
- This immediately triggered the reset effect, clearing all collected data
- The FeedbackScreen then received empty/default data (dataCount = 0, all ratings = [6,6,6])
- Result: No AI feedback generated, or generic "session too short" message

### 3. ❌ Missing Environment Variables
**Issue**: Server requires API keys in a `.env` file that doesn't exist.

**Required Variables**:
- `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` - For speech-to-text
- `LAVA_BASE_URL` - For AI model access
- `MODEL_URL` - Specific model endpoint
- `LAVA_FORWARD_TOKEN` - Authentication token

## Solutions Applied

### Fix 1: Video Recording - Added Timeslice Parameter
**File**: `client/src/components/SpeechCoach/RehearsalPage.tsx`

**Change**:
```typescript
// Before:
mediaRecorderRef.current.start();

// After:
mediaRecorderRef.current.start(1000); // Request chunks every 1 second
```

**Benefits**:
- Ensures data is captured during recording, not just at stop
- More reliable video playback
- Better memory management (chunked data)

### Fix 2: Prevent Premature Data Reset
**Files Modified**:
1. `client/src/hooks/useVisualSentiment.ts`
2. `client/src/components/SpeechCoach/RehearsalPage.tsx`

**Changes**:

**In useVisualSentiment.ts**:
- ✅ Removed automatic reset on `isStarted = false`
- ✅ Added manual `reset()` function to return object
- ✅ Added to interface: `reset: () => void`

**In RehearsalPage.tsx**:
- ✅ Updated `handleReset()` to call `visualSentiment.reset()` explicitly
- ✅ Now data persists until user clicks "Try Again"

**Flow Now**:
1. User clicks Stop → Recording stops
2. `isStarted` set to false → Stops sentiment capture
3. **Data is preserved** → FeedbackScreen receives it
4. FeedbackScreen fetches AI feedback with valid data
5. User clicks "Try Again" → THEN data is reset

### Fix 3: Enhanced Logging
**Files**: `RehearsalPage.tsx`, `FeedbackScreen.tsx`

**Added Console Logs**:
- Recording chunk sizes
- Sentiment data counts before stopping
- AI feedback API calls and responses
- Video URL creation
- Error details with helpful messages

**Benefits**:
- Easy debugging
- Visibility into data flow
- Quick identification of API issues

### Fix 4: Environment Setup Guide
**Files Created**:
- `server/SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Instructions for setting up API keys

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Set Up Environment Variables
```bash
cd server
# Create .env file and add your API keys
```

Refer to `server/SETUP_GUIDE.md` for details.

### 2. Start the Server
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

Server should start on `http://localhost:3000`

### 3. Start the Client
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

### 4. Test Recording & Feedback

1. Navigate to Rehearsal Mode
2. Click "Start" and practice for at least 10-15 seconds
3. Click the Stop button (X)
4. **Check browser console** for:
   - "Recording started with 1s timeslice"
   - "Recording chunk received: XXX bytes" (multiple times)
   - "=== STOPPING SESSION ==="
   - "Current sentiment data count: X" (should be > 0)
   - "Processing recorded chunks: X chunks" (should be > 0)
   - "=== FETCHING AI FEEDBACK ==="
   - "Data count: X" (should match sentiment data count)
   - "AI feedback received: {...}"

5. **Expected Results**:
   - ✅ Video recording plays back
   - ✅ AI feedback appears (not "session too short")
   - ✅ Performance breakdown shows actual scores (not all 6/10)

### 5. Common Issues

**If no video recording**:
- Check console for "Recording chunk received" messages
- Ensure webcam permissions are granted
- Try a different browser (Chrome/Edge recommended)

**If AI feedback says "session too short"**:
- Session must be at least 4-6 seconds (2-3 sentiment captures)
- Check console for "Current sentiment data count"
- If count is 0, check that API keys are configured

**If AI feedback says "Unable to generate feedback"**:
- Check server console for errors
- Verify `.env` file exists and has valid API keys
- Test API endpoints directly

## Technical Notes

### Why the Reset Issue Was Critical

The data flow was:
```
User clicks Stop 
  → isStarted = false 
  → useEffect in hook triggers 
  → Data reset to defaults 
  → FeedbackScreen receives [6,6,6] with dataCount=0 
  → "Session too short" message
```

Now it's:
```
User clicks Stop 
  → isStarted = false 
  → Data is PRESERVED 
  → FeedbackScreen receives actual data 
  → AI generates real feedback 
  → User clicks "Try Again" 
  → THEN reset is called
```

This was the main blocker preventing any AI feedback from working.
