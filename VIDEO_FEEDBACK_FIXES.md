# Video Recording & AI Feedback Fixes

## Date: Current Session

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Server Error Handling - API Endpoints Not Sending Responses
**Problem**: Both `/sentiment/visual` and `/feedback` endpoints were not sending responses when errors occurred, causing the client to hang indefinitely.

**Root Cause**: 
- Error handlers only logged errors but didn't send HTTP responses
- Client was waiting for responses that never came

**Solution**: Added proper error responses to both endpoints:
```javascript
// Before:
catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
}

// After:
catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to analyze visual sentiment', details: err.message });
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `server/app.js` (lines 103-106, 247-250)

---

### 2. ✅ Video Recording Not Starting - Webcam Stream Timing Issue
**Problem**: Video recording sometimes failed because the webcam stream wasn't ready when recording attempted to start.

**Root Cause**:
- Only checked once with a 100ms delay
- No retry logic if stream wasn't ready
- Silent failures made debugging difficult

**Solution**: 
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff (up to 10 retries at 200ms intervals)
- Enhanced error logging to show exactly what went wrong
- Better stream readiness checking

**Files Modified**:
- `client/src/components/SpeechCoach/RehearsalPage.tsx` (lines 88-172)

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
// Retry logic to ensure webcam stream is ready
let retryCount = 0;
const maxRetries = 10;
const retryInterval = 200;

const tryStartRecording = () => {
  if (webcamRef.current?.stream) {
    console.log("Webcam stream ready, starting recording");
    startRecording();
  } else if (retryCount < maxRetries) {
    retryCount++;
    console.log(`Webcam stream not ready yet, retry ${retryCount}/${maxRetries}`);
    setTimeout(tryStartRecording, retryInterval);
  } else {
    console.error("Failed to start recording: webcam stream not available after retries");
  }
};
```

### 3. ✅ Client-Side Error Handling Improvements
**Problem**: Client wasn't properly handling API errors, leading to unhelpful error messages.

**Solution**: Enhanced error handling in multiple places:

**Files Modified**:
- `client/src/components/SpeechCoach/FeedbackScreen.tsx` (lines 45-70)
- `client/src/hooks/useVisualSentiment.ts` (lines 36-58)

**Improvements**:
- Check HTTP response status before parsing JSON
- Extract error details from API responses
- Show specific error messages to users
- Better console logging for debugging

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `server/` directory:
```env
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key_here
LAVA_BASE_URL=your_lava_base_url_here
MODEL_URL=your_model_url_here
LAVA_FORWARD_TOKEN=your_lava_forward_token_here
```

### 2. Start the Server
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

### 3. Start the Client
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

### 4. Test Recording

1. Navigate to Rehearsal Mode
2. Click "Start" and practice for at least 10-15 seconds
3. Look for these console messages:
   - ✅ "Webcam stream ready, starting recording"
   - ✅ "Recording started with 1s timeslice"
   - ✅ "Recording chunk received: XXX bytes" (multiple times)
4. Click Stop (X button)
5. Verify:
   - ✅ Video playback appears
   - ✅ AI feedback is generated
   - ✅ Performance breakdown shows actual scores

### 5. Check Console Logs

**If video recording fails**, you'll see:
- "Webcam ref not available" OR
- "Webcam stream not available" OR
- "Failed to start recording: webcam stream not available after retries"

**If AI feedback fails**, you'll see:
- Specific error messages about API keys or server configuration
- Detailed error information in the browser console

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Webcam stream not available after retries"
**Solution**: 
- Ensure webcam permissions are granted
- Try refreshing the page
- Use Chrome or Edge browser
- Check if webcam is being used by another application

### Issue: "Unable to generate feedback: [API error]"
**Solution**:
- Verify `.env` file exists in `server/` directory
- Check that all API keys are set correctly
- Restart the server after updating `.env`
- Check server console for detailed error messages

### Issue: "Recording chunk received" messages but no video
**Solution**:
- This indicates recording is working
- Check browser console for errors during video creation
- Verify that MediaRecorder API is supported in your browser
