# Feedback Display Fixes

## Changes Made

### Improved Feedback Text Formatting

**Problem**: AI feedback was displaying as a single paragraph, making it hard to read bullet points and structure.

**Solution**: Enhanced the feedback display to properly format:
- **Bullet points** (detects `-`, `•`, or numbered lists)
- **Headers** (detects capitalized text ending with `:`)
- **Proper spacing** between paragraphs

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Splits feedback by newlines and formats each line
feedback.split('\n').map((line, index) => {
  const isBullet = line.trim().startsWith('-') || line.trim().startsWith('•') || line.trim().match(/^\d+\./);
  const isHeader = line.trim().match(/^[A-Z][^.!?]*:$/);
  
  // Render with appropriate styling
})
```

**Visual Improvements**:
- Bullet points get a purple bullet (•) marker
- Headers are bold and colored purple
- Proper line spacing between paragraphs
- Fallback for empty feedback

---

### Enhanced Error Handling

**Added**:
- Validation that feedback is a string before displaying
- Better error messages
- Debug logging to track feedback flow
- Fallback display when no feedback is available

**Console Logs Added**:
```javascript
console.log("Setting feedback:", data.result.substring(0, 100) + "...");
```

### Expected Feedback Format

The AI should return feedback in this format:
```
What you do well:
• You maintain good eye contact with the camera, which helps create a connection with your audience.

Areas to Improve:
• Your facial expressions could be more varied and engaging.
• You're fidgeting slightly, which can be distracting.
• Consider using more hand gestures to emphasize key points.
```

## Testing

1. Record a session (at least 10 seconds)
2. Stop the recording
3. Check the feedback screen:
   - ✅ Feedback should display with proper formatting
   - ✅ Bullet points should have purple markers
   - ✅ Headers should be bold and purple
   - ✅ Text should be readable and well-spaced

### Debug Checklist

If feedback doesn't display:
1. Check browser console for:
   - `"=== FETCHING AI FEEDBACK ==="`
   - `"AI feedback received:"`
   - `"Setting feedback:"`
2. Check server console for:
   - `"Received averaged ratings:"`
   - `"AI API response:"`
3. Verify feedback data structure:
   - Should be a string
   - Should contain bullet points or paragraphs
